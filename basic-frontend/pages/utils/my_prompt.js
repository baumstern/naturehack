  This study analyzed the water quality of the Morača River and its main tributaries, Zeta and Cijevna, using the Water Quality Index (WQI) and data from 12 hydrological stations between 2010-2018. The Serbian Water Quality Index (SWQI) revealed mostly good to excellent water quality, except for two lower Morača River stations with poor quality. Pollution sources included municipal wastewater, agricultural activities, and illegal garbage disposal. The lower Morača River, flowing through populated and agriculturally active areas, requires urgent wastewater treatment and public education on river conservation.

Water consumption and pollution have increased due to population growth and development, with wastewater affecting surface and groundwater. The Morača River catchment area in Montenegro, rich in natural resources and home to 50% of the country's population, is the focus of this study. The main goal is to assess the water quality of the Morača, Zeta, and Cijevna rivers using the Water Quality Index (WQI) method. This catchment area includes six municipalities and spans across two climate types. WQI has been used to analyze water quality in various studies, often incorporating physical, chemical, and biological parameters.

The Morača River and its tributaries, Zeta and Cijevna, flow through Montenegro's most populated areas and are crucial to the population. Water pollution in the Morača River Basin began in the second half of the 20th century due to industry and urbanization. Currently, municipal wastewater is the largest pollution source, with untreated wastewater discharged into riverbeds. Agricultural activities, industry, traffic infrastructure, and construction works also contribute to pollution. The study used data from 2010 to 2018 for 12 hydrological stations in the Morača River Basin, analyzing ten physiochemical and microbiological water quality parameters.

The Water Quality Index (WQI) method combines ten parameters into a single surface water quality indicator, each with its own weight or rank of implication. The WQI method simplifies analysis by producing a single number to represent water quality. The Serbian Water Quality Index (SWQI) was used in this study, calculated using a formula and a calculator available on the Environmental Protection Agency of the Republic of Serbia's website. The SWQI is classified into five categories, ranging from excellent to very bad. The advantages of the WQI method include the ability to compare water quality over time and between water bodies, but it has disadvantages such as not considering inorganic pollution like heavy metals.

Results:

The research analyzed the water quality index (SWQI) for rivers Morača, Zeta, and Cijevna using data from 12 hydrological stations. The results show that water quality has improved in recent years, with most stations recording excellent, very good, or good quality. However, the Morača River's Gradski kolektor station had poor water quality. The study suggests that variations in SWQI may be linked to hydrological conditions and pollution from settlements, agriculture, and industry. The researchers recommend using the WQI method in combination with other methods for future water quality assessments.

Conclusion:

This study aimed to assess Morača River Basin's water quality using the WQI method, which was adapted to local conditions. Despite some limitations, the WQI method is widely used and has been adopted by the Montenegro State Agency for Nature and Environmental Protection. The Serbian version, SWQI, was used in this study with data from 12 hydrological stations between 2010 and 2018. Results indicate that the water quality is not alarming, except in the City Collector (39-71 SWQI) and downstream Morača River sections. Poor water quality is due to increased wastewater, agricultural activities, and illegal waste disposal. Identifying pollution sources and implementing proper wastewater treatment can help improve water quality.
